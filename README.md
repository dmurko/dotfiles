# dotfiles

This are my dotfiles. Well actually this is my nix-darwin config which also contains dotfiles.

To install nix-darwin I’ve followed these instructions: 
- Setting up Nix on macOS.
- Install nix using Determinate System’s shell installer BUT select Nix from the official nixos.org repo and not Determinate Nix.

The idea is to use only nix-darwin to control macos settings and packages. Don’t use homebrew (because with this setup you won’t need it).

Once you’ve installed and configured nix-darwin you should also add home-manager.

For an example of dotfiles look at zupo’s repo.
